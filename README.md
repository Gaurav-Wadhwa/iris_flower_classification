## Iris Flower Classification using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Problem Statement

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three distinct categories: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. The classification is based on four features - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset comprises 150 instances, distributed equally among the three classes.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

1. **sepalLength**: Sepal length in centimeters
2. **sepalWidth**: Sepal width in centimeters
3. **petalLength**: Petal length in centimeters
4. **petalWidth**: Petal width in centimeters

The target variable is the class label of the iris flower, with values 1 (Iris Setosa), 2 (Iris Versicolour), or 3 (Iris Virginica).

### Classes

1. **Iris Setosa**: Recognized for its unique characteristics.
2. **Iris Versicolour**: Known for versatility in petal and sepal characteristics.
3. **Iris Virginica**: Distinguished by larger size and distinct features.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to implement a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for accurate classification of iris flowers based on sepal and petal characteristics.

### Usage

This project serves as a template for utilizing k-Nearest Neighbors for iris flower classification. Researchers, data scientists, and machine learning enthusiasts can leverage the provided code, documentation, and results to understand and experiment with the KNN algorithm on the Iris dataset.

### Implementation

The key steps involved in this project include:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset, visualizing feature distributions, and identifying potential patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding class labels for compatibility with the KNN algorithm.
3. **KNN Model Development**: Training and evaluating the KNN model on the dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the KNN model using appropriate metrics.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn (for KNN implementation)
